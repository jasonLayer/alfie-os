# Weekly: HQ Update Generator

Scans all teamspace HQ pages, aggregates activity from the past 7 days across 6 databases per HQ, and writes a structured weekly update to each HQ page's right column.

## HQ Map

| HQ Page | Teamspace | Abbreviation | Page ID |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| JR HQ | OS | JR | 78d0d32a-2816-82ac-bb6c-8102dd589ee1 |
| mGTM HQ | mGTM | mGTM | 2590d32a-2816-8033-85cb-cf9a2d964df1 |
| PoaM HQ | PoaM | POAM | 2d50d32a-2816-812b-8855-dc198be78feb |
| Radhouse Games HQ | Radhouse Games | RADG | 3080d32a-2816-81ba-88cc-e9a152a56eff |
| StyleIcon HQ | StyleIcon | ICON | 31e0d32a-2816-8114-824a-d7208341ee85 |

## Process

### Step 1: Determine Scope

- If a specific teamspace is named → update only that HQ
- If "all" or no argument → iterate through all 5 HQ pages
- Default date range: last 7 days (overridable)

### Step 2: For Each HQ Page

#### 2a. Load HQ Page
Fetch the HQ page using `mcp__notion-personal__notion-fetch`. Identify:
- The Admin section (contains the 6 databases)
- The right column (where updates go)
- The Mission Statement callout
- The existing "This Week's Update" section (if any)

#### 2b. Scan 6 Databases (Last 7 Days)

Query each database for entries created or modified in the past 7 days:

1. **Plans DB** — active plans, completed plans, new plans
2. **DocsAndResource DB** — new docs, updated docs, by type
3. **AIOUTPUT DB** — new AI outputs, by type (Analyst/Digest/Radar)
4. **Meetings DB** — meetings held, key decisions
5. **Updates & Maintenance** — system changes, maintenance items
6. **Templates DB** — new or modified templates

Use `mcp__notion-personal__notion-query-database-view` for each.

#### 2c. Also Gather Git Activity

For teamspaces with registered projects (check `~/.claude/memory/project-registry.md`):
- Run `git log --oneline --since="7 days ago"` in each project directory
- Summarize: number of commits, key features/fixes

#### 2d. Evaluate Mission Statement

Read the existing Mission Statement callout. Only update if:
- There's concrete evidence the focus has shifted (e.g., a major plan completed, new initiative started)
- Never change it just because — preserve stability

#### 2e. Write the Update

Use this template:

```markdown
# This Week's Update
---
**Week of [Start Date] — [End Date]** — [TeamSpace Name]

## Completed
- [completed plans, shipped features, finished docs]

## In Progress
- [active plans, ongoing work]

## Flags & Attention
- [blockers, risks, items needing Jason's attention]

## By the Numbers
X plans active | Y completed | Z new docs | W meetings

## Looking Ahead
- [what's coming next week based on active plans and tasks]
```

For quiet weeks (< 3 items total), use a simplified single-paragraph format instead.

#### 2f. Apply Update

Use `mcp__notion-personal__notion-update-page` with `update_content` command.
- Only touch the right column "This Week's Update" section
- Never touch: left column, Nav, Workbench, Admin toggle

#### 2g. Log the Update (Optional)

Create an entry in the Updates & Maintenance DB:
- Name: `Weekly Update — [Date]`
- Type: maintenance
- Status: completed

### Step 3: Summary

After all HQ pages are updated:

```
Weekly updates complete!

JR HQ: 3 completed, 5 in progress, 2 flags
mGTM HQ: 1 completed, 3 in progress, 0 flags
PoaM HQ: quiet week (single paragraph)
Radhouse Games HQ: no activity
StyleIcon HQ: 2 completed, 4 in progress, 1 flag
```

## After Completion

Record that weekly ran (for autopilot reminders):
```bash
date +%Y-%m-%d > ~/.claude/hooks/.last-weekly
```

## Guardrails

- **Scan all 6 databases per HQ** — never skip any, even if empty
- **Use relative date queries** — "last 7 days" not hardcoded dates
- **Never touch the left column** — updates go in the right column only
- **Don't overwrite Mission Statement every week** — only when there's real evidence of evolution
- **Don't create duplicate entries** if run twice in the same week — check for existing update first
- **Gracefully handle:** non-conforming pages, empty databases, placeholder mission statements
- **Auto-publish:** After writing to Notion, confirm with link

## Auto-Publish

This skill writes directly to Notion — no separate publish step needed. The output IS the Notion update.
